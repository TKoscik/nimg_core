## Tools and scripts for neuroimage processing

### Mission Statement
Restructure personnel and technologies to streamline neuroimage processing in order to provide:
  * ‘on-arrival’ image processing
  * immediate quality control
  * neuroimage processing at the cutting edge of available tools
  * an intuitive data product to facilitate more timely research, growth in serviceable projects, and multi-site collaborations.

### Goals
  * clear the current processing backlog
  * reorganize data structures
  * to accommodate data sharing under an open-science framework
  * to facilitate development of standard, automatable processing procedures
  * prepare templates, scripts, and functions to implement an ‘on-arrival’ processing pipeline
  * coordinate with PIs to prepare required functions BEFORE data collection begins
  * provide simple QC reports to PIs and their labs to provide oversight and accountability for the quality of data collection and processing
  * develop standard procedures and maintain these with the best available programs and methods
