# Iowa Neuroimaging Core

## What We Do
Our goal is to provide image processing services to support biomedical research that utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the University of Iowa. Our services focus on a few critical components to all MRI studies; these include: (1) 'cleaning' the images, (2) assessing the quality of images, (3) extracting biologically- and research-relevant information, and (4) applying statistical models to test research hyptheses. The steps required to acheive these goals require many niche skills at the intersection of radiology and medicine, psychology, anatomy, computer science, and software development and implementation.

We plan to provide:  
  * consultation in study design and planning to ensure high-quality, relevant data collection and customization to researchers needs  
  * data services, including data organization and data sharing  
  * process development for novel analytics and to integrate advances in methods  
  * training for investigators, research assistants, and students to implement MRI processing themselves  
  * quality control, including easy-to-interpret reports, for each step in our process  
  * MRI data processing (cleaning the data and extracting meaningful variables)  
  * MRI data statisical modelling (hypothesis testing, modelling research questions)  


## Tools for streamlined neuroimage processing  
### Mission Statement  
Our goal is to restructure personnel and technologies to streamline neuroimage processing in order to provide:
#### 'on-arrival', automated image processing  
We are working toward pushing our processing pipelines to get scan data *from the scanner into a useable data product within 72 hours* of each scanning session. Toward this end, we hope to *engage researchers* early on in the study planning process to construct pipelines and tools that match data and give the best possible results according to a study's design. In addition, engaging researchers earlier in the process allow us to build the scripts and tools needed for projects, *before* data collection begins, so that data can be processed as it is acquired. 
#### immediate quality control and accountability  
We are working to implement quality control metrics and procedures to ensure that the data and processing steps are high quality. We are developing ways to make *quality control more intuitive* such that researchers and their teams can be more engaged and accountable for the quality of their own data (without being bogged down by the minutia).  
Critically, we aim to have quality control reports available within 72 hours of each scanning session such that quality control issues can be addressed while a study is ongoing or participants might be re-called, rather than waiting until after a long time period has past or data collection is complete.  
#### maintenance of 'cutting-edge' imaging techniques  
Given the fast and sporadic pace of change in the field of neuroimaging, we will continually update methods and build on existing tools to ensure that data processing is maintained at the current standard for the field.
#### to provide an intuitive data product  
We are building or neuroimaging tools geared toward improvements in *reproducibility, collaboration, and data-sharing* including using and building upon 'industry standards' and data formats (e.g., [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/)) that can be fed directly into analytic and statistical pipelines.  
Our hope is that easier and more rapid access to imaging results will result in shorter time periods between data acquisition and publication, growth in neuroimaging collaborations and projects, and facilitating multi-site collaborations.
