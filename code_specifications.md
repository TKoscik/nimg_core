# Script Specifications

To enhance useability and enforce some consistency across scripts and functions
please follow these guidelines when writing shell scripts.

***

## Licence
All scripts should be written using "The Unlicense" https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/  
By uploading to the nimg_core, you are automatically under this licence unless otherwise noted in the preamble to your script/function and the proper licensing criteria are followed for those specific files.

***
## Script/Function Operators
All scripts and function should be designed to follow and benefit from the data specifications as laid out here: https://github.com/TKoscik/nimg_core/blob/master/data_structure_specifications.md  
Everything should be designed from the ground up to be user friendly and transparent in what the functions/scripts do.  
Documentation included as callable output is mandatory, and inline documentaion is strongly encouraged.
