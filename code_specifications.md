## Licence
All scripts should be written using "The Unlicense" https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/
By uploading to the nimg_core, you are automatically under this licence unless otherwise noted in the preamble to your script/function and the proper licensing criteria are followed for those specific files.
