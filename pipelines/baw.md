# BRAINSTools (BAW) Pipeline

1. Create .csv database file for sample you want to run through BRAINSTools BAW 
```
Use this script to find all your T1s and T2s and make the desired csv file:

https://github.com/TKoscik/nimg_core/blob/master/tools/BRAINSTools_csvcreator.sh
```
2. Create a config file for the projcect you want to run through BRAINSTools BAW   
```
Create a config file using this file as your template and edit the lines described in the header:

https://github.com/TKoscik/nimg_core/blob/master/tools/BRAINSTools.config
```
3. Login to argon and start your BRAINSTools processing
```
You will need the csv file from Step 1, the config file from Step 2, and the following runbaw.sh file:

https://github.com/TKoscik/nimg_core/blob/master/tools/runbaw.sh

To start BRAINSTools processing in argon you need to do the following commands 
(described in config header as well):

export PATH=/Shared/pinc/sharedopt/apps/anaconda3/Linux/x86_64/4.3.0/bin:$PATH
bash runbaw.sh -p 1 -s all -r <SGEGraph|SGE> -c <YOURCONFIGFILE>.config

Notes on SGE vs SGEGraph: SGE runs each job node of pipeline in serial while SGEGraph farms out all the jobs at 
once and then waits for each dependency to resolve before running next job

```
4. Troubleshooting failures
```
Failure cases and workarounds can be found here:

```
5. Dataset creation in R via Tim's functions
```
Example below of how to generate csv summary datasets for analysis is below

devtools::install_github("TKoscik/tkmisc")
library(tkmisc)
library(nifti.io)
library(R.utils)

bt_summarizer(data.dir = "/Shared/nopoulos/BRAINSTools_Experiments/20160525_BAW_JointFusion/20160525_Kids_base_Results/KIDSHD",
              scratch="/Shared/nopoulos/BRAINSTools_Experiments/20160525_BAW_JointFusion/data/scratch",
              label.csv="/Shared/nopoulos/kidsHD_btSummaries/brainstools-summary-labels.csv",
              save.dir="/nopoulos/BRAINSTools_Experiments/20160525_BAW_JointFusion/data",
              file.name="KIDSHD_BrainsTools_Summary_20180905.csv")

```
