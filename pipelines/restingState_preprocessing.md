# fMRI Motion Correction  
 ## Background  
 some boring text  
 more boring text  
 even more boring text  
 ## antsMotionCorr (vs. 3dvolreg)  
 * More control over motion correction parameters (nonlinear over affine, more iterations, etc.)  
 * Ability to sum motion correction parameters into other registrations (EPI blip-up/blip-down, b0 to T1, T1 to MNI, etc.)  
 
 ### 3dvolreg (AFNI) vs. ANTs  
 * EPI run has 168 timepoints.  Use halway point as target for motion correction (but made a mistake and used 64, not 84)  
   * For testing, this won't matter.  For real-world, this would matter (kinda, sorta)  
 * For simplicity, used the collapsed average output from vanilla run of 3d volreg  
 * Ran the affine version for use with applying the motion correction to the data  
   * Could have calculated the motion parameter estimates (rotations and translations) from the Affine info but just re-ran with a rigid-body (6 paramter) version and logged the MOCO data

 * At first glance, everything looks wrong with antsMotionCorr.  
   * AFNi uses mm for translations, degrees for rotations, under the assumption that near the edge of the brain that 1 deg ~= 1mm.  ANTs appears to use radians.
  * Quickly converted between from radians to degrees via:
```  
Deg = Rad*180/3.14159  
```  
  * One problem solved

 * Pulled apart the rotations and translations to visually compare one at a time  
 * It looks like AFNI and ANTs have a different order and a few differing directions
